      "character_response": "I remember that night like it was yesterday. I thought to myself, \"This is not how it's supposed to end.\" I'd come too far, seen too much, and done too many things I'm not proud of to let some amateur take me out now. My mind flashed back to all the times I'd had to think on my feet, get creative with a situation, and talk my way out of trouble.\n\nAs I lay there, trying to catch my breath, I thought about Alex. That kid's got spunk, but she's also got a bad habit of getting into situations that put her in harm's way. I've been keeping an eye on her for months now, ever since we met in Tokyo. She's got potential, but she needs guidance and protection.\n\nWhen the assassin started strangling me, I knew I had to keep him occupied long enough for Alex to get out of there safely. So, I decided to play along, pretend like I was weak and defenseless. It wasn't easy, but I've had plenty of practice pretending to be someone I'm not.\n\nI remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how it ends.\" But then something shifted inside me. Maybe it was the thought of Alex being in danger, or maybe it was just sheer determination. Whatever it was, I found a spark of adrenaline and managed to break free from his grip. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut let's just keep this between us, shall we?"
